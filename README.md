Thank you for the additional information. With this in mind, hereâ€™s an updated detailed description of your Tableau project:

This Tableau project is a comprehensive analysis of housing data, providing a multi-faceted view of key metrics in an easily digestible format.

1. House List: This table on the left side of the dashboard displays the count of houses categorized by the number of bedrooms. It provides a quick overview of the distribution of houses based on bedroom count. The table is filtered to exclude certain types of rooms, ensuring that the data presented is relevant and accurate.
  
2. Number of House for Bedroom Count: This bar graph complements the House List by visually representing the quantity of houses available with different bedroom counts. The use of a bar graph makes it easy to compare the quantities at a glance.
Revenue for Year: This line graph at the top right corner of the dashboard depicts the trend of actual and estimated revenues over time. The light blue area represents the prediction of future revenues. It provides valuable insights into the revenue performance and can help identify patterns or anomalies in the data.

3. Price per Zipcode: This colorful bar graph at the bottom left of the dashboard displays housing prices according to different zip codes. It provides a geographical perspective on housing prices, which can be useful for identifying high-value and low-value areas.

4. Average and Individual Revenue: This bar graph at the bottom right of the dashboard illustrates the average and individual revenues based on the number of bedrooms in houses. It provides insights into the revenue potential of houses with different bedroom counts.
  
5. Overall, this Tableau project provides a comprehensive and detailed view of housing data. It effectively visualizes complex data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner, making it a valuable tool for understanding housing market dynamics. The dashboard can be used to inform decision-making in real estate investment, property management, and other related fields. Let me know if you have any other questions!
